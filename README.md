in development

## Pipline workflow

- STEP1: __Mapping__ contigs to reference genome and __Filtering__ non-chloroplast contigs by BLAST search
- STEP2: __Cutting__ non-homologous region in each contigs
- STEP3: __Selecting__ no-overlapped contigs
- STEP4: __Replacing__ reference sequences with sequences of no-overlapped contigs
